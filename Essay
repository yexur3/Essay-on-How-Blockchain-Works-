An essay on “How Blockchain Works”
The first thing I would like to start with is what blockchain is. Blockchain is a chain of blocks, each block contains information, which are transactions. 
Transactions can be considered any action that you perform in cryptocurrency. Sending coins to another account, interacting with some protocol, swapping tokens - these are all transactions. There are also two types of blockchains, they are POS (proof-of-stake) and POW (proof-of-work). The example of Pos is Ethereum blockchain and the main example of Pow blockchain is Bitcoin. In blockchain, in order for a transaction to go through, it needs to be validated. Validators exist for this purpose. The way it works in POW is that the validator solves a certain math problem, thereby getting a hash of the transaction and it is validated. The POS has a slightly different system. To become a validator in Pow you need to have the same computing power, and in Pos you only need to pledge some coins to become a validator.
This is general information written, it doesn't say what problems blockchain has, what consensus protocols and sharding are and that there are more layer-2 blockchains.
